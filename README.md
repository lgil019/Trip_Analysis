### Recommendations

- Average Distance Traveled per Trip:

Enhance Trip Offerings: Consider offering additional amenities or services for biking trips, as they cover the longest average distance (17 miles). Highlight unique experiences and benefits of biking trips with marketing campaigns.

Adjust Pricing Strategies: Evaluate the pricing models for hiking and paddling trips to ensure they compliment the average distances covered. They also can offer bundle packages or discounts for longer trips to encourage more bookings.

- Average Expenditure per Trip:

Enhance Customer Value: Since hiking generates the highest total expenditure at $107,475 explore opportunities to increase the perceived value of hiking trips through premium packages and exclusive offers.

Revenue Diversification: Promote biking and paddling trips more aggressively to balance revenue streams. Introduce promotions or discounts to attract repeat customers in these categories.

- Trip Bookings by State:

Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Focus marketing efforts on states with lower bookings such as Connecticut with 367 customers. Utilize local advertising and promotions tailored to these regions.

Customer Retention in High-Volume States: Implement customer retention strategies in states with the highest bookings like New Hampshire with 2,864 customers so we can maintain and grow the customer base. Offer exclusive deals and personalized rewards to loyal customers.

- Seasonal Trip Bookings by State

Seasonal Promotions: Leverage the seasonal popularity of destinations such as Maine in early fall and late spring and New Hampshire in summer. Design targeted promotions and special events during peak seasons to maximize bookings.

- Total Expenditure by Customer Segment:

Customized Offerings: Develop tailored packages and marketing strategies for each customer segment. For example, create premium packages for government customers, who have the highest total expenditure and offer specialized educational field trips to attract more spending from schools or universities.

Membership Incentives: Encourage annual memberships by highlighting the benefits and potential savings as annual members have a substantial total expenditure. Introduce referral programs and additional perks for corporate customers to boost their engagement as they are the least engaged in spenditure.
